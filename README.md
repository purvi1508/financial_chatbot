# financial_chatbot
The Financial Analysis Chatbot Project aims to create a chatbot capable of offering meaningful financial advise based on an analysis of a Kaggle dataset, specifically the 'Family income and expenditure' dataset. The project involved several preprocessing steps, including correlation analysis, categorization of expenditures and financial situations, and prioritization of income sources. The project also included the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 model for text creation and the construction of an LSTM model using TensorFlow and Keras.

Accomplishments:
Preprocessing: I completed all of the necessary preprocessing procedures on the dataset, including producing a heatmap to visualise correlations, categorising expenditures by level and location, and categorising total spending and income for a more complete financial picture.

Machine Learning Model: Using TensorFlow and Keras, I built an LSTM model. An embedding layer, an LSTM layer with dropout and recurrent dropout, a dense layer with softmax activation, and a dropout layer for regularisation were all part of the model design. The model was trained and tested using test set.

Limitations and Challenges:
Throughout the project, I encountered severe limitations and challenges that greatly hindered the chatbot's ability to provide accurate and trustworthy financial advice. The integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 model was unsuccessful, as the model prepared itself  lacked accuracy, relevance, and coherence. The model exhibited a fundamental inability to comprehend the intricate nuances of financial advice, leading to misleading and unreliable recommendations. Regrettably, these limitations severely compromised the overall reliability and user experience of the chatbot, rendering it ineffective for its intended purpose.
